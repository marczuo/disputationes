_"Nam efficit hoc philosophia: medetur animis, inanes sollicitudines detrahit, cupiditatibus liberat, pellit timores."_

Eboracenses Disputationes is the personal website of Marc Zuo, formerly known as Lutetianae
Disputationes. It may or may not have anything to do with philosophy, poetry, mathematics or any
number of languages dead or alive, but you may want to look somewhere else if you are looking for
[theological disputations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disputation).

The name of the website comes from Cicero's philosophical treatise, [_Tusculanae
Disputationes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusculanae_Disputationes), from which a quote is displayed above. Despite
the name, this site is not intended to host rigorous philosophical essays, but rather anything pertaining to one or more
of my interests.
