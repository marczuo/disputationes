Sea of gold, blindingly glistering and gleaming,   
Beneath the relentless blazes of the sun   
The realm of nourishing mother peace unfurls   
Over the bleak, bare and barren wilderness.  
  
Tranquility—panacea of the soul.    
Here lie the olden gods, here lie fallen men.    
Forgotten alike by the world, they are sleeping   
One eternal somber, soundless and solemn.  
  
Pillarless, roofless, the very land beneath   
Stood, temple invisible, eternally   
Tended by the sun, by the wind, by the earth,   
A hall without walls, prayers without a priest.  
  
Land of the Garamants? Perhaps the Augyls?    
It matters not; mere mortals these sacred grounds.    
Shall not claim. In this divine abode walked gods.    
Their strides turned into gold, treasures of mankind.  
  
Once they did—long, long ago, a golden age   
Saw them reigning over these lands. In those days   
The earth was fertile and rivers flowed freely.    
Trees, flowers grew here, jubilant, full of vigour.  
  
So, they say, was the desert born; forbidden   
To mortals, yet holding such allure meanwhile   
That they have fought here, with iron and with blood,   
Ruinous wars; death polluted these very grounds.  
  
Shrines looted, marble torn off, brazen mankind   
Earned the immortal furor of the gods.    
Gold they turned into worthless sand, the very land   
Turned sterile, Shining marble changed into soot.  
  
Such wrath men had wrought—even their rotten corpses   
Were covered over and over by sand dunes.    
Divine fury knew no bounds. At last these lands   
Became one with death, harsh and unforgiving.  
  
Flowers withered, rivers dried up, raging storms   
scattered all into the heavens. No sign, no trace   
Left of the lofty splendor that once stood here.    
A golden hue remained, but all else was gone.  
  
So the gods have done, but their own abode too  
They have destroyed; and with a long, heavy sigh  
They closed shut, one by one, their all-seeing eyes.  
Immortal gods knew not death; they slept in peace.  
  
But one—one alone looked over the desert,   
The deathly land they had formed; It was Beauty,   
Goddess supreme, who wept, a singular tear   
For the divine splendor that was gone forever.  
  
And lo—her tear touched the sand, from which at once   
Trees sprouted out, lake filled with precious ichor.    
An oasis, jubilant and triumphant,   
The final gift she gave to a weary world.  
  
And so have men, ever dreaming of divinity,   
Sought, to no avail, the golden oasis.    
Generations have come, generations buried   
Underneath, along their warlike ancestors.  
  
Yet do they know the price of that which they seek?    
Immortal life condemned to this hellish land,   
Their thoughts their own worst prison—Infinity   
Without purpose, their being is nothingness.    
  
The gods sleep below, soundly; so too will men.    
Come now, wayfarer; why run after the gods   
When so much still remains, the joy of living;  
Turn back, turn back! Beyond here lies only death.  
  
Leave this cursed place; leave this golden temple  
To the gods who fashioned it! We must live on.  
And when at last the breath of life should fail us,  
May we then find peace, under this sea of gold.
