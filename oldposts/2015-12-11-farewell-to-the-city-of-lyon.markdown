Farewell, Lyon immortal, to thee,  
fairer than a thousand lasses,  
still thou fear’st not th’ adversary,  
whom thy power far surpasses.  
Farewell! Farewell! Dainty faces  
who thy loveliness embellish,  
for you so resplend with graces,  
which henceforth I’ll e’ermore relish.  
  
Farewell, city precious to me,  
and thy people most appealing,  
may Lord grant good fortune to ye  
more than to me He was willing.  
For you have been gladly filling  
my stay with your kindness abound.  
Of which how much I’d be telling,  
were it not so diff’cult to count.  
  
Farewell, old men in happ’ness bound  
though in love can no more flourish:  
for a love of virtue you've found  
which your soul shall surely nourish.  
I’d hate to seem rude and churlish,  
and so I have undertaken  
your gravestones some words to furnish,  
if I shan’t be sooner taken.  
  
Farewell, children shrewd and witty,  
whose fate concerns all of mankind:  
oft’ you’ve come to hear me ditty,  
which can’t all be due to my mind.  
Thank thee, littl’ Muse, one of a kind;  
trust me, I am not invidious:  
Ev’ry pretty girl one can find  
has a husband foul and hideous.  
  
Farewell, Saône, and thy darling,  
comely Rhône, who southward dashes:  
thou departest for Avignon,  
while I take my leave for Paris.  
I’d say farewell, dearest mistress,  
but in fact ‘tis more befitting  
if I said “farewell, youthfulness,  
since white hair comes unremitting.”  
  
Go then, good Lyon, God be willing;  
far too long hath frolick’d the cretin  
in thy cavern dank and chilling,  
where many times had he been beaten.  
‘Tis for thee, too, for good reason,  
reverend Tournon, true believer,  
fare thee well in every season,  
since thou art Lyon’s august leader.
