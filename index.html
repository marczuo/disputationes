<div id="homepage-quote" title="“For mortal beings who live on this Earth, the best thing of all is to not have been born and never to see the light of bright sun; but those of us who are born already can hope to pass through the gates of Hades as quickly as we can, and to lie under a tall mound of earth.”"><a href="#">
	“Πάντων μὲν μὴ φῦναι ἐπιχθονίοισιν ἄριστον
	μηδ᾽ ἐσιδεῖν αὐγὰς ὀξέος ἠελίου,
	φύντα δ᾽ ὅπως ὤκιστα πύλας Ἀΐδαο περῆσαι
	καὶ κεῖσθαι πολλὴν γῆν ἐπαμησάμενον.”</a></div>
