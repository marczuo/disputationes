by Horace_

Wings uncommon and splendid  
shall bore me, two-formed poet, through flowing ether,  
nor shall I linger long on earth  
but from the cities I shall depart, far above vulgar envy.  
  
‘Tis not I, descended from poor  
parentage, not I for whom you call, dear Maecenas,  
who shall pass away in death,  
and whom the Stygian waves will detain below.  
  
Now, already, tough skin settles  
on my legs, into a white bird I am changed,  
and light feathers grow above  
through my fingers and my shoulderbones.  
  
Already more famous  
than Daedalean Icarus, I (now a sweet-sounding bird)  
shall visit the shores  
of groaning Bosphorus, the Syrtis, and the Hyperborean fields.  
  
The Colchians will get to know me,  
alongside the Dacians, who hide their fear of Mars’s cohort,  
and the farthest Gelonians;  
so shall skilled Spaniards and drinkers of the Rhône learn of me.  
  
And so chase away lamentations from  
my empty funeral, and ugly weeping and voices of despair;  
restrain the noises, I bid you,  
and forego unnecessary honours upon my grave.
