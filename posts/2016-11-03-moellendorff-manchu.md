The following text is from *A Manchu Grammar with Analysed Texts* by P. G. von
Möllendorff. The description given there follows:

>The text is taken from the “*Tanggū meyen*” (Hundred Chapters) a book of
Manchu–Chinese dialogues, v. page 10 of my “Essay on Manchu Literature” in
Journal of C. B. of R. A. S. vol. xxiv (1890). The Chinese version of these
dialogues is familiar to every student of Chinese, as it forms the “Hundred
Lessons” in the Tzū-êrh-chi of Sir Thomas Wade, of whose classical English
translation I have availed myself. By comparing the Chinese of these dialogues
the interesting fact will be noticed that certain peculiarities of Pekingese
are Manchuisms foreign to ordinary “Mandarin”.

Note: Make sure that you have a font that supports the Manchu script, such
as [Abkai Xanyan](http://abkai.net/core/en/sibe/sibe-fonts/).

<span class="smallcaps">Senior.</span> So I hear you are studying Manchu, eh?
That's right. Manchu is with us Manchus the first and foremost of essentials;
it is to us, in short, what the language spoken in his own part of the country
is to a Chinese; so it would never do to be without a knowledge of Manchu,
would it?

<span class="smallcaps">Junior.</span> To be sure not. I have been studying
Chinese for over ten years, but I am still as far as ever from seeing my way in
it. Then if I can't master Manju and learn to translate, I shall have broken
down at both ends of the line.
