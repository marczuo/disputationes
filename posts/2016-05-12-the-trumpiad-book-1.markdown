Of untimely disaster I sing, which first befell the race  
of America, proud and haughty, and which to the brink  
of destruction took them, nearly appointing as leader  
a most insolent man, who wears an orange mane about.  
Much, too, was the conflict stirred up in high heavens,  
as gods battled gods, goddesses goddesses, until at last  
peace was found again, and ultimate disaster averted.  

Who was it, Muse, who at first this insolence wrought?  
Olympian Zeus, the Thunderer, and his son Argeiphontes;  
for in high Olympos the gods make their home, over  
and above, ceaselessly watching the affairs of mortals;  
but now the high heart of Zeus the Thunderer groaned  
and called upon the gods and goddesses to congress.  
And when he saw that the other gods are all present,  
he before all others started to speak in winged words.  
«Ye gods, hear of this new thing which troubles me:  
you know well that to all peoples of the world  
I render visit from time to time, testing them;  
and when I came to visit the American race, I found  
a people once known for its daring and boldness  
now descended into timidity, and fear, and suspicion,  
as an eagle, weighed down with the scar of its age,  
who in former days would lord over the mountains,  
chasing after its prey with arrow-like speed, now  
lie vanquished in its nest, languidly eying the forest  
in disapproval, and dreaming of its younger years;  
in this state I saw that people, who must be punished.  
Now come, ye gods, and let us design a suitable fate  
for the mortals who dwell beyond roaring Atlantes;  
as long ago I myself had appointed destruction  
for the race of Lykaon, when that impertinent man,  
seeing the approach of a humble guest, who in truth  
was I myself, in disguise as a peasant, offered fine meal,  
but in which was admixed a most foul ingredient,  
the entrails of innocent children: for thus he wished  
to confound me, and to lead me into criminality.  
But I, since I am a god, and blessed with perspicacity,  
saw through it all, and in my anger threw over the table,  
and changed the form of that accursed man, so that  
in appearance he should resemble his blackened heart.  
But moreover—as venerable Poseidon, bull of the sea,  
no doubt recalls—I bid him to sweep away the mortals  
in a great flood; wherever Nereus sounds, throughout  
the whole world. Perhaps you, too, will recall, that  
of all the mortals, eaters of bread, two alone survived,  
Deukalion, the sailor, and his wife, circumspect Pyrrha,  
who, out of so many, alone were pleasing to me; thus  
I give proof of my rage, and punish the offending race.  
But now the monkey-like people of America, as you see  
plainly with your own eyes, have grown a thousandfold  
more insolent than even Lykaon’s race.» Thus he spake,  
and shook three times his formidable mane, and then  
a fourth time, leaning into his ivory scepter, and groaned.  
Nor, O immortal gods, did you dare to look away once;  
for Zeus reigns over Olympos, and makes the law  
for mortals and gods alike. But now spake Argeiphontes,  
son of the immortal Thunderer, messenger of the gods:  
«There is none, Father, who dwells in high Olympos  
and does not see the dissoluteness and debauchery  
of that monkey-like people. For in truth they cling to  
their glorious past, ever dreaming of its return, and thus  
are blind to the future and fearful of everything foreign.  
But still tell us, Father, of the fearsome punishment  
which you have reserved for that impudent people.  
Do you, perchance, aim to set ablaze their homes  
with your unerring lightning-bolts, burning down  
their houses, fields, and livelihoods? Or do you, as before,  
plan to smite them with flood, bidding great-maned  
dreadful Poseidon to let loose water and wind admixed?»  
Then the mighty Thunderer addressed his son thus:  
«What you say, my son, are not at all unpleasing to me;  
for the people of that race deserve all that we can devise.  
But in truth, as the condemned prisoner often wishes  
rather to die, if there is any honor left in him, than  
to endure bondage, so too death will come too easy,  
not altogether satisfactory, nor dark destruction.  
Moreover we immortal gods, if we wish to destroy  
someone, or perchance all the mortal races, or even  
nymphs, fauns, and satyrs, who properly are half-gods,  
we may accomplish it: such is the power which we wield.  
It matters not, then, whether a race is virtuous, or  
wholly given to criminal deeds, as that of Lykaon;  
to be destroyed thus is no punishment, but merely  
the doings of inscrutable Fates, who spin their threads  
for all. No; if ever the Americans are to be punished,  
it must be by their own hands; to death and disaster  
we shall merely lead them, and watch as they walk in,  
spurred by their own depravity and not by our will.»  
Thus he spake, and the immortal gods all nodded.  
For mighty Zeus spake with reason, and in any case  
none among them wished to incur his august wrath.  
Then the grey-eyed goddess Athene spake thus:  
«The fate of a people, I say, if we immortal gods do not  
interfere, owes much to its leader: what sort of man  
he is, or what sort of woman. Thus if we should wish ill  
on that monkey-like race, which they are to enter into  
by their own volition, and not our incontrovertible will,  
we need but to thrust upon them a foul and vile man  
as their leader, and watch as they invest in him power.»  
To this the mighty Thunderer nodded in approval:  
«Have no fear, ye gods, for we see all and hear all  
which underneath the snowy peaks of Mount Olympos  
should perchance take place in the world of the mortals.  
I know of a man who, if ever there is one unsuited  
to the rigors of leadership—and I should know it well,  
being leader of the most august heavenly abode myself—  
can claim that title effortlessly, so abominable as he is.  
Yet the race that dwells beyond the roaring Atlantes  
demonstrating its dissoluteness, has made him richer  
beyond all mortals, since he is by as much more decadent;  
for this crime alone, even if they were otherwise virtuous,  
that race deserves what we now purpose to inflict on them.  
But come, Argeiphontes Hermes, since you are my son  
and always I have called upon you, should a message  
to some god or mortal I wish to send. Go forth to America,  
and bear my winged words to Donald of the orange hair.  
Say that he is to contest for the leadership of his people,  
and persuade him by all means to persevere in this goal.»  

Thus the mighty Thunderer spake, and Hermes obeyed.  
Presently he took the form of a winged bird and flew away,  
down from the snow-covered peak of high Mount Olympos  
across innumerable lands and seas, and roaring Atlantes  
‘til he landed on the gilded window-seams of Trump Tower.  
Just presently Donald of the orange hair was soundly asleep,  
blissfully unaware of the presence of the winged god.  
So Argeiphontes took the form of a venerable old man  
and entered the dream of Donald of the orange hair.  
Thus he approached addressed Donald with winged words:  
«Donald Trump, wherefore do you wander aimlessly,  
without energy and altogether listless? I have come  
to bear a message from my father, Zeus the Thunderer:  
he bids you to contest for the leadership of your people  
and promises to see to it that you defeat your rivals.  
For the gods are mighty, and their words are accomplished.  
So you will become president, and be glorious even more.»  
Thus he spake, but Donald of the orange hair responded:  
«Leave me be, old man, and stop preaching your gods.  
For in our world it is money which accomplishes things,  
which effects our will. We have then no need of gods.  
Besides, what use, tell me, do I have for the presidency?  
I am already fabulously rich, with a name known to all.  
Tell this god of yours that I have no need for much else.»  
Thus he spake, and the haughty heart of Hermes sank.  
So Argeiphontes accosted Donald of the orange hair again:  
«What sort of word escaped your teeth’s barrier, Donald?  
Do you then not have any respect for the gods at all?  
For in truth I tell you that, if not greed, then green fear  
should suffice to compel you to obey my father’s will.  
For beyond all others he hates those who deny his power,  
insolent men, who fancies themselves above his reach.  
Indeed, if you refuse him, the god will devise for you  
all kinds of cruel punishment, that others may fear him.»  
But Donald of the orange hair did not desist from his ways,  
but replied thus in shameful words: «a loser you are,  
since you worship this phony god of yours, stupid old man.  
I, for one, have no fear nor respect of anyone like him.»  
Thus he spake, and Argeiphontes, enraged by his insolence,  
contemplated striking the orange-haired simpleton down,  
as once he struck down fearsome Argos the all-seeing  
on his father’s command, when the giant was set by Hera  
to watch over the hapless nymph Io, whom Zeus desired.  
So, too, his sturdy heart stirred to take up the spear,  
and, first heating up its tip in a fire, then strike brutally at  
that most insolent man, through the heart, but cutting off  
his tongue, from which winged words of impertinence issue,  
and to display it as a warning to other insolent mortals.  
But at this Zeus the Thunderer stayed his hand, saying:  
«Do you dare, reckless one, to deny my will by slaying him?  
In truth I am not unsympathetic to you; truly that man,  
whom you hate so much, is insolent beyond all mortals  
who had lived under Helios the shining or dusky Selene,  
and far and above more hateful to all we immortals.  
Still I remind you that my will is sovereign over Olympos,  
over all the fields of Thessaly and beyond in the world.  
You will do well to see to it that my will be accomplished.»  
So he spake, and the haughty heart of Hermes sank.  
Protesting for himself, Argeiphontes thus replied:  
«In truth I have no wish, Father, to contradict you;  
but it is not possible to move this man to action  
by entreaties and by intimidation; for by so much  
he hates and disrespects and mocks our sovereignty,  
and I cannot bid him to do a thing, without first  
visiting destruction on him and all that he has,  
so that by action he sees that we are indeed powerful.»  
But the Thunderer, almighty Zeus, was wholly unmoved.  
He sternly struck Hermes by the cheeks, saying:  
«What sort of words escaped your teeth’s barrier, son?  
For you seem to suggest that our will is accomplished  
by one way alone, namely by force and by violence.  
In truth, perhaps I should have appointed your sister,  
who in the way of crafty deception far exceeds you,  
and who would have found some way to persuade him.»  
So he spake, and the haughty heart of Hermes sank.  
Protesting for himself, Argeiphontes thus replied:  
«Do not, O immortal Father, king of great Olympos,  
humiliate me so by turning the task over to Pallas,  
but allow me to go back to that insolent man again.  
For in truth I, too, am not unknown for shrewdness,  
and I will see to it that your will be accomplished.»  
Thus he spake, and the great Thunderer was satisfied.  
But presently Argeiphontes Hermes shed his disguise,  
since he saw that Donald of the orange hair accorded  
little respect to old age, but now he took on the image  
of long-enduring Barack Obama, Donald’s nemesis.  
Now he again entered the dream of the insolent man  
and accosted Donald of the orange hair in this way:  
«Donald Trump, are you still playing the fool now?  
Do you still make yourself the butt of jokes, idiot,  
by beating the dead horse over my birth certificate?  
In truth you know as well as anyone, that the fuss  
about me being born in Kenya is all trumped-up (ha!),  
and all your money and fame cannot save you now  
from being consigned to the garbage heaps of history  
as a harmless little buffoon of no significance at all.  
For in truth I tell you, fool, that I am the president  
of these most exalted United States of America,  
a position which carries reputation far ahead of me,  
and a good name, so that I will be taken seriously,  
while you will always be known as a witless clown.»  
So he spake, and the inward heart of Donald was enraged.  
Hurling a statuette at the phantom image, he spake thus:  
«Little Barry, are you not content to stay at the receiving end  
of my jokes? Do you wish to provoke the sleeping dragon?  
For in truth I can command respect whenever I wish,  
and my support will be greater, and far stronger than yours.  
Truly, I say, you test my patience for one last time.»  
But Argeiphontes to this laughed heartily—inwards,  
he congratulated himself over the success of his ruse,  
but to Donald of the orange hair he appeared still  
as battle-wearied Obama, whose name is anathema.  
Now seeing his arch-nemesis laughing in such a way,  
the very blood of the insolent man boiled in his veins,  
and he thus addressed Argeiphontes in winged words:  
«In truth, Barry, you laugh because you are president,  
and you think that you are far better than me for it.  
But in truth you underestimate me, for now I too  
will throw my name into the presidential elections,  
and I will command as many supporters as there are  
stars in high heavens, and sand in the Libyan desert.  
But now put this other thing away in your heart,  
in case you laugh at me, and say that never ever  
will I get the people’s support and be elected.  
For indeed not much earlier before you visited me,  
a phantom image appeared, of some obscure old man.  
Indeed he spake, and told me that the very gods  
favor my election, and will help me be elected.  
Now, though I am no one to submit myself to a god,  
still I should hope that it is an omen of good things.»  
Thus he spake, and Argeiphontes was happy.  
Swiftly he changed back into the form of a bird,  
flying out of the tower, out of bustling Manhattan  
and across innumerable lands and seas, ‘til he reached  
Thessaly and high Mount Olympos, abode of the gods.  

Now when Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,  
and Donald of the orange hair awoke from his sleep,  
then he summoned his staffers, miserable men,  
who work ceaselessly at the billionaire’s bidding.  
Seeing that his men are gathered in his spacious office,  
which in style, though not in size, approached Olympos  
and the hallowed palace of mighty Zeus, the Thunderer,  
that insolent man spake, his secretary taking notes:  
«Be advised, ye who serve me in my business dealings.  
For long I have wished, all in jest, to campaign  
for the presidency, though none takes me seriously.  
Now the time is come, I believe. Go and summon  
the Media, so that I will announce my candidacy.»  
Thus he spake, but his finance officer objected:  
«Truly, Mr. Trump, what you say to us is the law.  
Though we are but feeble and worthless men  
compared to your greatness, boss, we do endeavor  
to accomplish all that you bid us to accomplish.  
But in this one matter I do not know if the course  
of action, which you have devised, is wise or not.  
For surely a prudent man, when he desires  
to campaign for national high office, starts  
by building up a record and a good network,  
which takes years, and cannot be done at once.»  
But now Donald of the orange hair rebuked him:  
«Insolent man, do you wish to earn my ire so?  
Either the heart in you stirs for dark destruction,  
or you are foolish, and must be taught a lesson.  
Truly, I tell you, for mine is the power: you are fired!»  
So he chased the finance officer out of his tower,  
before the horrified eyes of the other staffers,  
so that none else dares to object to him again.  
Seeing this, Donald of the orange hair was satisfied,  
and he dismissed them, still holding a grudge  
against battle-wearied Obama, in whose image  
Argeiphontes spurred him to run for the presidency.  

But now as mighty Hera, worshipped in Samos,  
retreated to her chambers, her divine heart  
was filled with doubt, as a vessel filled to the brim  
with viscous ikhor, such that at the slightest  
disturbance it is at risk of toppling and falling.  
Without letting mighty Zeus, the Thunderer, know,  
she summoned the goddess shining Aphrodite  
and addressed her thus in winged words:  
«Kytherian Aphrodite, shining among goddesses—  
it is hard, you know, for me to utter this—  
nevertheless I beseech you for help, friend,  
for I fear that my husband, mighty Zeus,  
once again plots some escapades with his son.  
You know well that those two, my husband  
and that accursed Hermes, illegitimate issue  
of his, can never be up to any good together,  
but always they plan for him to be with some  
harlot or another, diminishing my authority;  
for though I am the rightly wed consort of his,  
still he strives ever to lie with other goddesses  
and even mortal women, who bear for him  
innumerable children. I speak of Maia, that  
nymph who bore him the very son Hermes,  
and Kallisto, and Io the daughter of Inakhos.  
Clearly all my efforts have failed me, you see,  
and I must enlist your help on this matter.  
For yours is the power over love and lust, and,  
powerful though he may be, almighty Zeus  
cannot escape your eyes in his dallying.»  
To this the goddess shining Aphrodite said:  
«I am moved, great Hera, by the honor you do me;  
but this thing of which you say is not easily done.  
For I am mindful of the fate suffered by Argos,  
the all-seeing giant, slain by Argeiphontes,  
and I by no means wish that Zeus the Thunderer  
should perchance harbor any ill will towards me.»  
But mighty Hera thus sought to assuage Aphrodite:  
«Fear not, great Aphrodite, who in beauty far  
surpasses not only the immortals, but also all  
nymphs, half-goddesses, and mortal woman.  
Indeed Zeus appeared vehement during our council,  
and he spake as if he truly desired dark destruction  
for the mortal races, as back in the days of Lykaon.  
In truth, I tell you that he is not as level-headed  
as he makes out to be. If ever a people truly  
enraged him, he would show no self-control,  
but would hurl his lightning bolts about freely,  
casting down to darkly Styx all his enemies.  
Thus I think it most suspicious that he has shown  
such restraint in dealing with those Americans,  
and if it is true that he has some ulterior motives,  
which he has yet to share, all that you need to do  
is to share them with me, and then I will deal  
with the matter. You yourself are in no danger.»  
So she spake, and the goddess was persuaded.  
She promised solemnly to keep watch over Zeus,  
and the haughty heart of Hera was satisfied.  
Thus she dismissed Aphrodite, shining among goddesses,  
and went back to her daily work, inwardly groaning.
