It is that familiar moment again when journalists have to learn the jargon of
yet another one of the Internet's myriad communities as an event has catapulted
them to international prominence; this time, however, the circumstances are far
more sinister, the event far more unsettling: for the group in question is none
other that the infamous "Incels", a gathering of young men united by virulent
misogyny and in their admiration for Elliot Rodger, the college shooter who
targeted women, believing himself to be exacting revenge for the perceived
injustice they have done to him. The event itself, unfortunately, is an even
more ramped-up re-run of Rodger's murder spree: the killer, Alek Minassian,
took a page from the Islamic terrorist playbook and ran people down in a van,
killing 10 and injuring others. The clue that sent journalists on a frantic
mission to uncover more about the online Incel community: Minassian's post
praising Rodger and calling for an "Incel rebellion" published moments before
the crime. Overnight, a word belonging to the darker corners of the Web became
the latest focal point in the politics of society. Who are the Incels, and what
exactly do they want? Panicked observers try to figure out.

In this case, one can easily point out the fact that mass murder by lonely,
disaffected young men is nothing new. Whether by means of guns or otherwise,
we've unfortunately been here numerous times before already, and one should of
course contextualize Minassian's latest crime in this background. Yet there is
something new, something quite unseen before in his attack compared to the
outbursts of young male rage that we have sadly all seen too much of:
a certain, that is to say, ideological coherence—or at least semblance
thereof—which Minassian, the perpetrator, could cite to justify his act. But
why should we even consider the ideological justifications terrorists as
a matter of definition rely upon? Some may ask. After all, we know well from
experience that terrorists often have a "true" reason for committing
atrocities—alienation from family, fame-seeking, et cetera; it is a certain
intellectual fashion to dismiss out of hand what terrorists *say* they want for
what *truly* motivates them. Thus, one might argue that the Minassian case is,
after all, not substantially different from all the public shootings we have
witnessed before: the only difference lies in a fiction, something immaterial,
intangible, which obscures and covers up the *real* motivations, which we need
to consider as opposed to superficialities in order to understand and hopefully
prevent these attacks in the future.

Against this sort of reasoning, we must raise the question of which is more
"true", the Real of the concrete situation Minassian found himself in, the
meaningless and humdrum elements of his life that pushed him to commit such
a heinous crime, or the Symbolic fiction of the Incel ideology which we might
hypothesize that Minassian only latched onto in order to give sense to his
desires?
