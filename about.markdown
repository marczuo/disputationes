This is the personal website of Marc Zuo. It may or may not have anything to do with philosophy,
poetry, mathematics or any number of languages dead or alive, but you may want to look somewhere
else if you are looking for [theological disputations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disputation).

The name of the website comes from Cicero's philosophical treatise, [_Tusculanae
Disputationes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusculanae_Disputationes), Lutetia being the ancient
name of Paris (_Lut√®ce_ in French), the city I live in. Despite the name, this site is not intended
to host rigorous philosophical essays, but rather anything pertaining to one or more of my
interests.
